[Live website](https://campusconnect.me) (Inactive)

This project is a social media study web app programmed in React, a JavaScript framework.

### Technology used

- React
- NextJS
- JavaScript

The website is served from a NextJS server, which also serves API endpoints.

The hosting provider is Digital Ocean.

### Testing

API endpoint tests are contained in the `tests` folder, along with documentation for each endpoint in the `docs` folder.

### Formatting

Code style and formatting is enforced by Prettier, an NPM package which auto-formats the code to a certain standard.
This can be done with the `npm run format` command in terminal.

### Ethics

We have an extensive privacy policy/terms and conditions hosted on our
[website](https://campusconnect.me/termsAndConditions)

### Running the server

To run the development server:

Install nodejs from [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and then run

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
